# Day 22: Binary Search Trees

### Objective

Today, we're working with Binary Search Trees (BSTs).
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-search-trees/tutorial)
tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf.
You are given a pointer, _root_, pointing to the root of a binary search tree.
Complete the _getHeight_ function so that it returns the height of the binary search tree.

### Input Format

Read the inputs and assemble them into a binary search tree:
The first line contains an integer, _n_, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the _n_ subsequent lines contains an integer, _data_,
denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

### Output Format

The locked stub code in your editor will print the integer returned by your _getHeight_ function denoting the height of the BST.
