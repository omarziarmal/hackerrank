# Day 25: Running Time and Complexity

### Objective

Today we're learning about running time! Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a number, _n_, determine and print whether it's **Prime** or **Not prime**.

**Note:** If possible, try to come up with a  primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an  algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **T** , the number of test cases.
Each of the **T** subsequent lines contains an integer, _n_, to be tested for primality.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ _T_ ≤ 30
* 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 2 x 10

### Output Format

For each test case, print whether _n_ is **Prime** or **Not prime** on a new line.

### Sample Input
```
3
12
5
7
```
### Sample Output
```
Not prime
Prime
Prime
