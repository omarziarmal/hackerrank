# Day 9: Recursion

### Objective
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called _Recursion_.
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial
```
factorial(N) is 1 if N ≤ 1
factorial(N) is N*factorial(N-1) otherwise
```

### Task
Write a _factorial_ function that takes a positive integer,
_N_ as a parameter and prints the result of _N!_ (_N_ factorial).

**Note:** If you fail to use recursion
or fail to name your recursive function _factorial_, you will get a score of 0.

### Input Format
A single integer, _N_ (the argument to pass to _factorial_).

### Constraints
* `2 ≤ N ≤ 12`
* Your submission must contain a recursive function named _factorial_.

### Output Format
Print a single integer denoting _N!_.

### Sample Input
```
3
```

### Sample Output
```
6
