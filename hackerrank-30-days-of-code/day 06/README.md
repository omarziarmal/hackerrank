# Day 6: Let's Review

### Objective

Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings
and combining it what we've already learned about loops.
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop/tutorial)
tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

Given a string, _S_, of length _N_ that is indexed from 0 to _N_ - 1,
print its _even-indexed_ and _odd-indexed_ characters
as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, _T_ (the number of test cases).
Each line _i_ of the _T_ subsequent lines contain a String, _S_.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ _T_ ≤ 10
* 2 ≤ length of _S_ ≤ 10000

### Output Format

For each String _S_\[_j_\], print _S_\[_j_\]'s
_even-indexed_ characters, followed by a space,
followed by _S_\[_j_\]'s _odd-indexed_ characters.

### Sample Input
```

Hacker
Rank

### Sample Output
```
