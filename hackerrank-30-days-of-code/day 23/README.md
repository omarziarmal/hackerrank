# Day 23: BST Level-Order Traversal

### Objective

Today, we're going further with Binary Search Trees.
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-trees/tutorial)
tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search,
visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom.
You are given a pointer, _root_, pointing to the root of a binary search tree.
Complete the _levelOrder_ function so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

### Input Format

Assemble the input into a BST:
The first line contains an integer, _T_ (the number of test cases).
The _T_ subsequent lines each contain an integer, _data_, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

### Output Format

Print the _data_ value of each node in the tree's level-order traversal
as a single line of _N_ space-separated integers.
