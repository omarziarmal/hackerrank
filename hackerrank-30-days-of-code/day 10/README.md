# Day 10: Binary Numbers

### Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers.
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/tutorial)
tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task
Given a base-10 integer, _n_, convert it to binary.
Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in _n_'s binary representation.

### Input Format
A single integer, _n_.

### Constraints
* 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 10^6

### Output Format
Print a single base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of _n_.

### Sample Input 1
```
5
```
### Sample Output 1
```
1
```
### Sample Input 2
```
13
```
### Sample Output 2
```
2
```
### Explanation
#### Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of 5 is 101,
so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.
#### Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of 13 is 1101,
so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.
