# Day 1: Data Types

### Objective

Today, we're discussing data types.
Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/tutorial)
tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

The variables _i_, _d_, and _s_ are already declared and initialized.
You must:

1. Declare 3 variables: one of type _int_, one of type _doubhle_, and one of type _String_.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin and initialize your 3 variables
3. Use the `+` operator to perform the following operations:
   1. Print he sum of _i_ plus your int variable on a new line.
   2. Print the sum of _d_ plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
   3. Concatenate _s_ with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer that you must sum with _i_.
The second line contains a double that you must sum with _d_.
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with _s_.

### Output Format

Print the sum of both integers on the first line,
the sum of both doubles (scaled to 1 decimal place) on the second line,
and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
